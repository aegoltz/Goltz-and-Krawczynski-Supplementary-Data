This is the repository for supplementary data associated with the Goltz and Krawczynski (submitted) manuscript. 

The contents are as follows:

Supplementary Table 1. Computer-readable datatable, including key compositional and run information. Columns 6-12 are “factor” columns where “1” indicates the phase is present and “0” indicates its absence. Data in this sheet is formatted to be easily compatible with the Weber and Blundy (2024) data scheme.

Supplementary Table 2. Expanded, computer-readable version of Table 2, including uncertainties on phase proportions.

Supplementary Table 3. Computer-readable version of Table 3.

Supplementary Table 4. Weber and Blundy (2024) experimental database filtered for experiments containing olivine and amphibole. The database includes information about the experimental run and the source of the compiled experiment in addition to the composition of glass. To this information, we added the compositions of amphibole, olivine, and clinopyroxene, where available. 

Please do feel free to reach out if any more information is required!
